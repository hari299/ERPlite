This is the Repository for ERPlite support documentation, installers and business logic level source code.

We will be addng documents frequently to assist current users in using,supporting and customizing ERPlite.
 

The first entry is the installer ERPlitePro10299.exe for reinstalling ERPlite  on client PCs (ie Win10/Win8/Win7/WinXP....but not Windows Server).
1. Control Panel >> Programs and Features >> right click on ERPlite >> remove
2. Download ERPlitePro10299.exe....and double click on it to install....follow on screen instructions.

MORE support documents will be added soon.

The current ERPlite release is open source for the business level logic.....thus, the user can modify all reports, forms, tables etc to better meet their needs.
The only skills required to modify this version of ERPlite are Microsoft Access database  skills learnable from books like "Microsoft Access for Dummies" and like.

It is our intent to relase a full Open Source version of ERPlite within the next month, so that users can modify all code, including the dll's like EB.dll.

Since erplite.com inc, the original authors of ERPlite, is going out of business by end Feb 2021,   tech  support/bug fixing etc will be the responsibility of the user of ERPlite,  or a contractor that they hire.
